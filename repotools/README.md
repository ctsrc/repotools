# repotools

Short names, big time savings – a collection of commands for the git operations you perform most often.

Meaningful and memorable: All of the commands have names that, even though short, make sense... For the most part ;)

The commands are, in short order: `dp`, `aa`, `st`, `di`, `cm`, `pu` and `le`.

Read on below to see what they mean and what arguments they take, or
[skip straight to installation](#installation) if you are feeling too impatient.
(But do go back and read how to use them afterwards if you do go ahead and
install them right away.)

## Usage

## Installation

Precompiled binaries will be provided in the future.

For now you'll need the Rust toolchain installed.

If you don't have it already, head over to https://rustup.rs/ and follow
the instructions there and then come back here.

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, simply run:

```bash
cargo install repotools
```
